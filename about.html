				Hi, my name is Mario Cardenas.  I would like to invite you to see what we do at RS1 Motorworks.  I have lived in San Antonio all my life, and I am in love with San Antonio.  I have been in the Automobile business for the past 33 years, during which I have been in Sales, Management, Finance and Service.  I am passionate about the car business—it has supported my family, and it has taught me a great deal about people and the different characters and personalities out there!  Now that I am involved with RS1 Motorworks, I have fallen in love all over again with these fine works of art.  These automobiles are maintained in a temperature-controlled and humidity-controlled facility.  I am very proud to say that I am involved with RS1 Motorworks because they treat Customers and Employees with the upmost respect.

				I have been around cars since before I could walk.  At age 18, I started my first part-time business detailing cars.  While working in Retail Management/Operations Management for 10 years, cars were always my main passion.  In 2013, I left the retail management world to run my automotive detail business full-time, which included restoring, detailing and managing private collections of exotic motorcars.  In 2014, I joined the RS1 family, and knew we were a perfect fit for life!  Vault Auto Detail partnered with RS1 Motorworks to form Vault Auto Services.  We now have a state-of-the-art, climate-controlled storage facility offering all levels of car care, from a basic wash to a full concours detail.  As a national award-winning detailer, I can assure you that your motorcar is in quality hands!
